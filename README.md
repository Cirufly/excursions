# Excursions
#### It's Codecademy exercise.
______________________________
## What did they asked?
#### In this project, you’ll create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” You’ll use your growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. You’ll be proud of yourself when it all comes together!

## Personal opinion:
#### I think I quite did what they asked me to do and I'm quite proud. Although would love to get some feedback on how to make my code more readable or shorter. Thanks
